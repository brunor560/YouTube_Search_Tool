#shakespear,d3T7CheR1GY,What Did Shakespeare Really Sound Like? 🎭🗣️,"Ever wondered what William Shakespeare’s accent actually sounded like? 🤔 The English he spoke, known as Original Pronunciation (OP), was quite different from modern British or American accents! 🇬🇧🇺🇸

Shakespeare’s accent had hints of Irish, Scottish, and even American-sounding twangs! His plays rhymed better in OP, and puns made more sense. 🎭✨

Linguists have reconstructed this lost accent using historical phonetics and rhyming patterns in his plays. The result? A raw, lively, and expressive sound—very different from the posh Shakespearean tone we often hear today!

Want to hear it for yourself? Drop a 🎭 in the comments! ⬇️

#shakespear,3sP7kfLzlkc,The Romantacized Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet #art #history #romeoandjuliet #shakespeare,"""Juliet,"" painted by John William Waterhouse in 1898 and ""Romeo and Juliet,"" painted in Frank Dicksee in 1884

The first painting is Frank Dicksee's Romeo and Juliet. I've always thought it as visually stunning- in fact, in may be one of my favorite paintings visually. When I say I'm not a fan of it, I mean entirely as a representation of Romeo and Juliet. In contrast, the second painting, Juliet, by Waterhouse, has always been one of my favorite paintings of the play, because even though it's less stunning than Dicksee's artwork- it feels like it truly captures how young and naive Juliet was- which makes the story so much more tragic.

Short background on Romeo and Juliet's story 👇

Romeo and Juliet is a tragic love story written by William Shakespeare, centered on two young lovers from feuding families in Verona: the Montagues and the Capulets. When Romeo Montague crashes a Capulet party, he meets Juliet, and the two instantly fall in love, unaware of each other’s identity. Despite the hatred between their families, they secretly marry the next day with the help of Friar Laurence, hoping their union might end the bitter rivalry. But as tensions escalate—fueled by duels, revenge, and miscommunication—Romeo kills Juliet’s cousin Tybalt and is banished from Verona.
Their separation sets off a tragic chain of events. Juliet fakes her death to be with Romeo, but the message explaining her plan never reaches him. Believing she is truly dead, Romeo takes his own life beside her. When Juliet awakens and finds Romeo dead, she ends her life as well. Their deaths finally shock the Montagues and Capulets into peace, but only after love, innocence, and youth are destroyed. Romeo and Juliet remains a timeless story of passion, impulsive choices, and the devastating cost of hatred.

#shakespear,_MFyGHxpWl0,Was Shakespeare Actually A Black Playwright Named John Black?,"Shakespeare was Black... or might’ve been. I know, your English teacher probably just fainted.

But hear this: There’s barely any record of William Shakespeare’s life. No confirmed portraits. Some say the man we credit might’ve actually been John Black, a Black playwright whose work was stolen and repackaged.

From Othello to sonnets filled with rhythm, soul, betrayal, Moors, and rebellion, Shakespeare's work sounds more like a spoken word cypher than a royal tea party.
Could he have just stolen from Black contemporaries? Maybe.
But one thing’s clear: Black brilliance shaped the Bard—either directly, or through theft.

So yeah, your fave might’ve been ghostwritten by melanin.

👇🏾 Let’s talk about it. What do YOU think—was Shakespeare Black, or just borrowing the vibe?

#shakespear,5q_suWzPDZA,David Oyelowo performs speech from Shakespeare's Coriolanus ⚔ #NationalTheatre #shakespeare,"Warrior. Hero. Traitor.

Unrivalled in the art of war, undefeated on the field of battle, Coriolanus is Rome’s greatest soldier.

When a legendary victory brings the opportunity of high office, he is persuaded to stand for election. But while populist politicians tell the people what they want to hear, Coriolanus refuses to play the game. As Rome’s most celebrated warrior becomes its most dangerous enemy, the future of the city and its hero hang in the balance.

David Oyelowo (Selma, Lawmen: Bass Reeves) makes his highly anticipated return to the London stage in the title role. Lyndsey Turner (Under Milk Wood, The Crucible) directs a thrilling new production of Shakespeare’s timeless political tragedy.

Coriolanus is playing in the Olivier Theatre from 11 September.

#shakespear,VPWgqjOtRYw,Shakespeare's Unhappy Marriage #shorts,"Was Shakespeare unhappily married? This short video considers some of curious aspects of Shakespeare's marriage to Anne Hathaway. Who was Shakespeare's wife? A woman 8 years his senior, when he married her at 18. She might have been pregnant at the time of their wedding and whether or not Shakespeare and his wife, Anne, got along is not entirely clear. Some clues suggest that Shakespeare's marriage might have been unhappy. He might have been estranged from his wife. The playwright might have been in love with a beautiful young man, as is suggested by the sonnets. Not much is known about Shakespeare's marriage, but the few clues we do have raise many questions.

Explore the tragic tale of Othello by Shakespeare in this quick summary! Learn how jealousy and betrayal destroy Othello’s life and love. Watch now to dive into this classic tragedy! Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more Shakespeare insights!

Explanation 

Othello, the Moor of Venice, is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. It tells the story of Othello, a Moorish general, and the jealousy that leads to his downfall.

Othello secretly marries Desdemona, a noble Venetian lady, despite their racial and cultural differences.

Iago, Othello’s ensign, is envious of Othello's success. He manipulates Othello by planting seeds of doubt about Desdemona's loyalty.

Iago uses Desdemona’s handkerchief, a token of love from Othello, to convince him that she is unfaithful.

Othello becomes consumed by jealousy, accusing Desdemona of infidelity and confronting her, leading to tragic consequences.

Driven by jealousy, Othello tragically believes Desdemona's love has turned to betrayal.

In a fit of rage, he accuses her of infidelity and, in a moment of blind fury, strangles her with a pillow, silencing the woman he once adored.

Realizing too late that Desdemona was innocent, Othello is overwhelmed by guilt and takes his own life. 

The tragedy of Othello reveals the destructive power of jealousy and betrayal.

Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? Gives me the lie i’ th’ throat
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?
Ha!

But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this

#shakespear,5KFdGOeqw8o,How Did Shakespeare Innovate the Sonnet Form?,"Shakespeare innovated the sonnet by adopting and refining the English structure. Unlike the Petrarchan sonnet's octave-sestet format, Shakespeare used three quatrains followed by a rhyming couplet. This form allowed him to explore complex themes like love and mortality with layered arguments and impactful conclusions.

#shakespear,_jUOKEL0Z-I,Shakespeare For Every Day Of The Year - Day 248,"Hamlet - Act 1, Scene 3

This piece contains my favourite line in all of Shakespeare: “This above all, to thine own self be true”.
It really captures the best advice to lead your life and in a way, it contains the very heart of Hamlet, as his mission throughout the play is to expose all the treachery and deceit surrounding him.

Funny then, in that it’s not actually spoken by the Dane, but by Polonius, father of Ophelia and Laertes. In this scene, Laertes is heading back to France to resume his studies (although it’s hinted he doesn’t get up to much ‘studying’ if you know what I mean….) and Polonius gives him a ‘few’ parting words of wisdom. There’s something quite touching as well as funny about this speech as any parent who’s sent their child off to college will have tried to teach them these lessons and Shakespeare shows us that Polonius is actually a caring father to his children, although sometimes care turns to controlling.

Polonius really is a brilliant part for an actor. I’ve seen many of my favourite actors give superb interpretations of him, particularly Elliot Levey in the recent RSC revival. Peter Wight, one of Britain’s best character actors was also terrific in Robert Icke’s unique take on this tragedy.
Also, I’ll never forget Stephen Mangan’s interpretation! There was a special event last year at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre, based on this very book my challenge is based on, where an amazing cast performed a selection of pieces from the book. Mangan got Polonius, and every time Luke Thompson (playing Laertes) began to leave, he kept interrupting with yet another piece of advice.
His comic timing was impeccable!

But now….my turn! 
Hope you enjoy!
